Problem Statement: Automating Real-Time Threat Detection for Cardano DeFi

Sentinel Orchestrator Network (SON)
 is a decentralized AI-agent ecosystem that delivers real-time fraud detection, trust scoring, and verified real-world data feeds for Cardano wallets, DeFi protocols, and dApps.
Real-Time Threat DetectionSentinel Agents monitor mempool activity, analyze smart contracts, and scan token launches—flagging malicious transactions, scams, and rugpull patterns before they drain wallets.
Decentralized Oracle ConsensusOracle Agents scrape prices, news, and market data from multiple independent sources, then apply ML-driven anomaly detection to filter manipulation and deliver manipulation-resistant, trustworthy data feeds.
Hydra-Accelerated Multi-Agent ConsensusDetect, Verify, Compliance, and Arbitrate agents exchange evidence and resolve disputes in sub-second off-chain collaboration on Hydra, then publish verifiable results to Cardano L1 as immutable ThreatProof and FeedProof Capsules.
Self-Sustaining Agent EconomyMasumi powers automated payments, transparent competition, reputation-based ranking, and slashing mechanisms—ensuring agents stake collateral, earn micropayments, and get penalized for false positives or malicious behavior.
Instant Trust for Users & dAppsWallet plugins display SAFE/WARNING/DANGER ratings on addresses and transactions in real-time, while DeFi protocols consume trustless oracle feeds—unifying threat intelligence, decentralized oracles, and agentic coordination into one Hydra-native infrastructure.


Cardano's DeFi ecosystem is rapidly scaling, but it lacks real-time threat detection and trustless oracle infrastructure. Users and protocols rely on fragmented security tools, centralized data feeds, and manual verification — leading to millions lost in exploits, oracle manipulation, and scam transactions. Events like the 2024 DeFi hacks ($1.42B stolen) showed how fragile current systems are when threat intelligence, data verification, and consensus coordination fail simultaneously.

   Why SON Stands Apart as a Breakthrough Opportunity

Isolated security tools
Unified dashboard fuses threat data, oracle feeds, and agent votes
Manual fraud investigation
SON auto-publishes cryptographic ThreatProof Capsules on-chain

AI-Powered Threat DetectionSentinel Agents analyze contracts, wallets, mempool activity, and token launches to identify scams, rugpulls  in real time. Flags threats before they execute, protecting users from draining exploits.
Decentralized Multi-Source Oracle FeedsOracle Agents fetch prices, weather, and market data from multiple sources, then cross-verify using ML anomaly detection. Ensures manipulation-resistant, trustworthy data for DeFi protocols.
Hydra-Accelerated Agent ConsensusAgents share evidence, resolve conflicts, and in milliseconds using Hydra Heads. Produces reliable outputs off-chain without loading Cardano L1.
Immutable On-Chain Truth CapsulesVerified results anchor to Cardano as ThreatProof and FeedProof Capsules—cryptographically signed attestations. dApps and wallets instantly trust the intelligence.
Self-Improving Masumi Agent EconomyAgents earn micropayments, build reputation, and compete for accuracy through Masumi's marketplace. Economically incentivized network that gets smarter over time.
Key Features of the Sentinel Orchestrator Network (SON)
 Zero-Knowledge Privacy LayerZK-proofs verify sensitive data like sanctions matches without exposing raw information on-chain. Ensures regulatory compliance while maintaining user privacy.
Cross-Chain Oracle BridgeOracle Agents retrieve data from Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon, publishing cross-chain proofs to Cardano. Enables universal data integrity across networks.
Autonomous Agent Slashing & GovernanceAgents stake collateral; malicious agents get slashed through on-chain governance. Token-based voting removes defective agents and adjusts parameters.
Instant Wallet Risk ScoringBrowser plugins display SAFE/WARNING/DANGER ratings by querying ThreatProof registry. Protects users before interacting with flagged addresses.
 Automated Risk Insurance ContractsAgents classify risks and supply trigger data  to auto-configure smart contracts. Enables parametric insurance and DeFi yield protection.

Cardano L1 (Plutus V2)Hosts all smart contracts: Agent Registry, ThreatProof Capsule, FeedProof Capsule, and Governance/Slashing contracts. Anchors cryptographic truth on-chain with token minting for reputation and payments.
Hydra Layer-2Enables ultra-fast off-chain consensus between agents. Detect, Verify, Compliance, and Arbitrate agents share evidence, vote, and resolve disputes in milliseconds before publishing results to L1.cardano+2​
Masumi AI Agent EconomyPowers micropayments, agent registration (NFT-based identities), reputation scoring, and marketplace competition. Agents stake collateral, earn for accuracy, and get slashed for malicious behavior.house-of-communication+2​
PyTorch + HuggingFace TransformersRuns ML models for anomaly detection, scam pattern recognition, and oracle outlier filtering. Detect and Oracle agents use these to analyze mempool transactions and cross-verify external data feeds.
Lucid.js + CIP-30 Wallet APIHandles transaction building, signing, and wallet integration (Nami, Eternl, Lace). Enables users to connect wallets and interact with SON's risk scoring and oracle feeds directly from browser extensions.
IPFS + PinataStores encrypted evidence bundles off-chain (transaction logs, API responses, agent signatures). Only hashed commitments reach Cardano L1, ensuring scalability while maintaining verifiable proof trails.
Redis Streams / NATSMessage bus for agent-to-agent communication. Agents exchange evidence, coordinate tasks, and trigger consensus votes in real-time using gRPC for low-latency internal messaging.
FastAPI (Python) + Node.js (Express)Backend APIs for Masumi Orchestrator Service, Task Router, and Billing Logic. FastAPI handles ML-heavy agent workloads; Node.js manages lightweight orchestration and WebSocket live updates.
Pinecone / Milvus (Vector Database)Stores embeddings for agent memory and evidence recall. Enables semantic search through past ThreatProofs and FeedProofs, helping agents learn from historical patterns.
Prometheus + GrafanaMonitors agent performance, Hydra Head uptime, L1 settlement delays, and system health metrics. Real-time dashboards track threat detection rates, oracle feed reliability, and reputation scores.
ZK-Proof Engine (circom / gnark)Generates privacy-preserving attestations for sensitive data (sanctions matches, compliance scores). Allows verification without exposing raw information on-chain for regulatory compliance.
Blockfrost / KoiosCardano blockchain indexers for querying L1 state, tracking ThreatProof/FeedProof capsules, and monitoring agent registry updates. Provides REST APIs for frontend dashboards and wallet plugins.
React + Vite + TailwindCSSFrontend for live risk dashboard, oracle feed viewer, and Masumi agent marketplace. shadcn/ui components for UI; WebSockets provide real-time threat alerts and agent status updates.
Docker + KubernetesContainerizes agent runtimes and backend services. Helm charts deploy multi-agent clusters with auto-scaling based on task volume, ensuring high availability for fraud detection.
OpenWeatherMap API + Cross-Chain Bridges (Wormhole)Oracle Agents fetch weather data, news, and price feeds from external APIs and blockchains (Ethereum, Solana). Cross-chain proofs published to Cardano L1 enable multi-network data integrity.okx​

Tech Stack

Add as per the requirements for the hackathon:
Built entirely around Masumi’s Agent Framework: SON uses specialized Sentinel and Oracle Agents with identity, reputation scoring, and micropayment-based incentives — showcasing real multi-agent collaboration.
Demonstrates true agentic automation: Agents independently fetch data, analyze threats, vote, resolve disagreements, and generate on-chain outputs without manual intervention.
Leverages Cardano for verifiable trust: Final results are anchored as cryptographic Truth Capsules on L1, creating transparent, immutable proof that any dApp or wallet can rely on.
Uses Hydra for scalable coordination: Off-chain Hydra Heads enable sub-second agent consensus, aligning with the hackathon’s emphasis on performance and next-gen Cardano infrastructure.
Delivers a real, user-facing impact: Wallet/browser plugins and dApp integrations turn SON into a practical solution for everyday Cardano users — not just a backend concept.
